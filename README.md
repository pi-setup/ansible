#ansible-pi-setup 

##About
This is a pair of ansible plays intended to perform the following basic configuration tasks listed below. You must enable SSH on the target pi before this will work. 

- Install fail2ban
- apt-get update
- Upgrade all packages
- Add new user
- (optional) add authorized key
- delete pi user

##How To:
1. Enable the SSH server via raspi-config (advanced options>SSH) or your preferred method
1. Make sure you can successfully SSH from the ansible machine using pi/raspberry
1. Install [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
1. Run the main playbook `ansible-playbook -i TARGETIPADDRESSGOESHERE, -k main.yml`
..*	SSH Password: this is the password for the pi. By default it is 'raspberry'.
..*	Hostname: new hostname for the raspberry pi, use alpa numeric characters.
..*	Username: enter the username of the new user that ansible will create. 
..*	Password: enter salted pass for the new user (openssl passwd -salt <salt> -1 <plaintext>).
1. Test that you can ssh and sudo with you new username and password
1. If you can `ssh ansible-playbook -i TARGETIPADDRESSGOESHERE, -k cleanup.yml`

### WARNING: Fail2ban will keep brute force attacks at bay, but remember this setup is only as secure as the password for your new user. 

##Thanks:

I used the page below as a guide for what should be done. In addition to the current configuration a firewall would be also help with security but that more depends on the usecase for the server.
